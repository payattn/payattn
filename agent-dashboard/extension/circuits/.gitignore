# Large ZK circuit artifacts - keep version-controlled but gitignore binaries
# .zkey files and .ptau files are large (3-5 MB each) and shouldn't be committed

# Keep .wasm and .js in version control (needed for browser proofs)
# Keep verification_key.json in version control (small, needed for backend)

# Exclude only the truly large artifacts
**/*.ptau
**/*.zkey
