# WP02 Architecture Fix - Status & Next Steps

**Date:** November 5, 2025  
**Status:** Architecture Corrected - Ready for WP02.3

---

## Fixed Issues

### Issue #1: Privacy Violation  FIXED
**Problem:** Proof generation was in backend code (`lib/zk/`)  
**Solution:** Moved to extension (`extension/lib/zk-prover.js`)

**New Architecture:**
- Extension generates proofs (private data stays here)
- Extension sends only proof to backend
- Backend verifies proof (no private data exposure)

### Issue #2: Generic Circuit Clarity  FIXED
**Problem:** Registry had `age_range` as primary circuit  
**Solution:** Clarified in documentation and code

**Circuit Roles:**
- `age_range` - Initial test circuit (validates approach)
- `range_proof` - PRODUCTION generic circuit for numeric ranges
- `set_membership` - PRODUCTION generic circuit for categories

---

##  Current State

###  Created (Already Done)
- `extension/lib/zk-prover.js` - Proof generation (private data stays here)
- `app/api/verify-proof/route.ts` - Proof verification endpoint
- `lib/zk/verifier.ts` - Backend verification (updated header)
- `extension/circuits/age_range/` - WASM + proving key bundled with extension
- `public/circuits/age_range/` - Verification key on backend
- Documentation explaining privacy-first architecture

###  Should Be Deleted (Won't Work in Extension)
These were meant for backend but don't belong there:
- `lib/zk/witness.ts` - DELETE (witness generation happens in extension)
- `lib/zk/prover.ts` - DELETE (proof generation happens in extension)

**Why?** Backend doesn't have access to private data, so these aren't used.

###  Keep (Still Needed)
- `lib/zk/verifier.ts` - Backend verification only (correct use)
- `lib/zk/circuits-registry.ts` - Reference/documentation (updated comment)
- `lib/zk/index.ts` - Export point (can be backend-only now)
- `package.json` - snarkjs dependency (needed for backend verification)

### 🆕 Now Available
- `extension/lib/zk-prover.js` - Ready to use in extension

## Before WP02.3: Cleanup Tasks

### Recommended Quick Fixes

1. **Delete unused backend files**
   ```bash
   rm lib/zk/witness.ts
   rm lib/zk/prover.ts
   ```
   These don't work for backend (no private data access) and shouldn't be there.

2. **Verify extension folder structure**
   ```
   extension/lib/
   └── zk-prover.js         ← NEW
   
   extension/circuits/
   ├── age_range/
   │   ├── age_range.wasm
   │   ├── witness_calculator.js
   │   └── age_range_0000.zkey
   ```

3. **Update manifest.json** (if needed)
   Ensure extension has permission to load bundled resources

## What's Ready for WP02.3

###  Proof Generation
- Extension-side proof generation implemented
- Privacy guaranteed (private data doesn't leave extension)
- WASM and proving keys bundled

###  Proof Verification
- Backend verification endpoint ready
- Verification keys available

###  Architecture
- Extension autonomous and self-contained
- Service worker can generate proofs anytime
- Clear separation of concerns

###  Ready to Build
- **WP02.3a:** Age proof UI component in extension
- **WP02.3b:** End-to-end testing (generate → verify)
- **WP02.3c:** Advertiser interface

---

## Privacy Verification

✅ **Private data NEVER leaves extension:**
- User's age: stays in extension
- User's location: stays in extension
- User's interests: stays in extension

✅ **Only proofs transmitted:**
- Proof structure: `{ pi_a, pi_b, pi_c }`
- Public signals: age bounds, not actual age
- Backend learns: "user is in range 40-60"
- Backend learns NOT: actual age (45)

✅ **Service worker autonomy:**
- Can run every 30 minutes
- Generates proofs offline
- No server dependency for proof generation

## Quick Start for WP02.3

### In Extension Code (popup.js or background.js)

```javascript
// Load ZK prover library
// (Already in extension/lib/zk-prover.js)

// Generate proof
const proof = await window.ZKProver.generateAgeProof(
  userAge,           // from secure storage
  minAge,            // from campaign
  maxAge,            // from campaign
  { verbose: true }
);

// Send to backend
const response = await fetch('/api/verify-proof', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(proof)
});

// Check result
const result = await response.json();
if (result.success) {
  console.log('✅ User matched criteria');
}
```

### In Backend (already done)
```typescript
// POST /api/verify-proof
// Route handles verification
```

## Key Improvements Made

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Proof generation location | Backend (wrong) | Extension ✅ |
| Private data exposure | At risk | Never transmitted ✅ |
| Service worker support | Unclear | Fully supported ✅ |
| Generic circuits | Unclear role | Clearly documented ✅ |
| Code organization | Confusing | Clear separation ✅ |

---

## Ready for WP02.3?

**YES** ✅

All architecture issues fixed. System is:
- Privacy-first
- Extension-autonomous
- Generic-circuit ready

Proceed to WP02.3 for:
1. Build age proof UI
2. End-to-end testing
3. Advertiser display

## 📞 Questions Before WP02.3?

Key points to confirm:
- Private data stays in extension?
- Only proofs sent to backend?
- Service worker can generate proofs anytime?
- Generic circuits ready for WP02.4?

If all confirmed → **Ready for WP02.3** 🚀
