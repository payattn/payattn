- Public signals contain only [minAge, maxAge]
- Debug console shows privacy flow
- No accidental leakage of private data

### Error Handling Complete
- Missing profile handling
- Decryption failure handling
- Backend connection failure handling
- Invalid input validation
- WASM loading failure handling
- Clear error messages for all cases

### UI/UX Complete
- Dark theme matching existing design
- Responsive layout (works on all screen sizes)
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Proper button states
- Status indicators (loading/success/error)
- Progress visualization
- Copy functionality for JSON

## How to Test

### Quick Start (3 Steps)
```
1. Open: chrome-extension://YOUR_ID/age-proof-test.html
2. Wait: Profile auto-loads (watch debug console)
3. Click: "Generate Age Proof" → "Send to Backend & Verify"
```

### Expected Output
```
Console shows:
✅ Profile loaded successfully
🎯 User age extracted: 35
⚡ PROOF GENERATION STARTED
✅ Proof generated successfully
⚡ VERIFICATION STARTED
✅ Valid: YES
✅ VERIFICATION COMPLETE
```

### Privacy Check
Search debug console for your actual age value:
- Should appear ONLY in initial load section
- Should NOT appear after that
- Should NOT be in proof JSON
- Should NOT be sent to backend

---

## Test Coverage

### Tested Flows
1. ✅ Profile loading from chrome.storage
2. ✅ Profile decryption with keyHash/authToken
3. ✅ Age extraction from profile.demographics
4. ✅ Proof generation with advertiser criteria
5. ✅ Backend verification endpoint call
6. ✅ Result display
7. ✅ Error handling for all failure points

### Test Scenarios Ready
1. ✅ Normal match (user age in range)
2. ✅ Edge case - minimum (user at min boundary)
3. ✅ Edge case - maximum (user at max boundary)
4. ✅ Below range (should fail)
5. ✅ Above range (should fail)
6. ✅ Missing profile (error handling)
7. ✅ Decryption failure (error handling)
8. ✅ Backend unreachable (error handling)

## Privacy Architecture Implemented

### Data Flow
```
chrome.storage
    ↓
[Encrypted profile]
    ↓
[Decrypt with keyHash + authToken]
    ↓
User age: 35 (PRIVATE)
Advertiser wants: 25-65 (PUBLIC)
    ↓
[Generate proof in extension]
    ↓
Proof + [25, 65] publicSignals (NO 35)
    ↓
[Send to backend]
    ↓
Backend verifies
"You match criteria" (doesn't know 35)
```

### Implementation Details
- Profile decrypted in browser only (fetchKeyMaterial → decryptDataWithMaterial)
- Proof generation entirely in extension/lib/zk-prover.js
- WASM loaded from extension bundle (chrome.runtime.getURL)
- Proving keys never leave extension
- Only proof + publicSignals sent to backend
- Backend never receives or processes user's actual age

---

## What's Ready For Next Phase

### WP02.3b - Service Worker Integration
Test page validates all core functionality. Next phase will:
- Move proof generation to background service worker
- Run proofs every 30 minutes autonomously
- Store results for advertiser submission

### WP02.3c - Ad Queue Integration  
Once WP02.3b is complete, will:
- Add "Send ZK Proof" button to ad cards
- Show verification results in UI
- Integrate with Max's decision-making

### WP02.4 - Additional Circuits
Will build production circuits:
- range_proof (generic for any numeric range)
- set_membership (generic for categories)
- Support income, location, interests, etc.

## 🎓 Key Learning Points

### Privacy-First Design
This implementation demonstrates:
- Keeping private data in client-side extension
- Using ZK-SNARKs to prove facts without revealing data
- Never transmitting private information
- Backend verification without private data access

### ZK-SNARK Integration Pattern
- WASM witness calculators for efficient computation
- Proving keys bundled with extension
- Verification keys on backend
- Groth16 proofs (non-forgeable, 250 bytes each)

### Extension Development Pattern
- Using chrome.runtime.getURL for bundled resources
- Accessing chrome.storage.local securely
- Error handling for extension APIs
- Communication between extension pages

---

## Success Metrics

When you test and see ✅ for all:
- Profile loads from chrome.storage
- Profile decrypts without errors
- Age is extracted and displayed
- Proof generates successfully
- Public signals show [minAge, maxAge] only
- User's actual age NEVER in proof
- Backend accepts proof
- Backend returns valid/invalid correctly
- Debug console shows complete flow
- All error scenarios handled gracefully
- UI is responsive and clear
- System is reliable for repeated use
